This extension will install an API (Inheritedmembers.rebuild) which cycles through all current memberships attached to untrashed contacts which are configured using a parent membership type. Parent membership types are those which have a relationship type selected through which related contacts will receive an inherited membership.

After installing the extension, navigate to Administer > System Settings > Scheduled Jobs, locate the "Rebuild Inherited Memberships" job and configure/run as desired.

As with any script that bulk updates records, you are advised to run a backup prior to initiating this script.
